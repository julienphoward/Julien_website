        <div class="rectangle5"><p>While it has not been scientifically proven, torties are known for having an attitude, or "toritude."</p></div>
        <div class="rectangle6"><p>In Ireland, torties are thought to bring good luck. In Japan they are thought to protect against bad storms, shipwrecks, and ghosts.</p></div>
        <div class="rectangle7"><p>Chimera torties feature orange on one side of their body and black on the other, making them appear two faced. </p></div>
        <div class="rectangle8"><p>Poppy can be described as a "caliby", or a tortoiseshell with a white undercoat.</p></div>
