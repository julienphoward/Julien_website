            <p>Here you will find a photo gallery of Poppy, a 5-year-old American shorthair tortoiseshell cat. She was found abandoned by her mother when she was only a few days old. My family adopted her from a foster home a few months later. Poppy enjoys roaming the outdoors, catching mice, and knocking things over. Click around to find photos, fun facts, and more!</p>
